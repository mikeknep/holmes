# Holmes
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikeknep/holmes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikeknep/holmes)

Never lose at Clue again! (Unless your opponents are also using this app...)

### Setup

This app is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
To get up and running, clone the project and run the following from the project directory:
```
npm install create-elm-app -g   # globally, to make the `elm-app` command available
npm install                     # project dependencies
elm-app start
```
As Elm so nicely states, the project will be available at `localhost:3000`.

Been awhile? Consider blowing away the `package-lock.json` file and trying the above steps again.
