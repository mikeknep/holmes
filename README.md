# Holmes

Never lose at Clue again! (Unless your opponents are also using this app...)

### Setup

This app is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).
To get up and running, clone the project and run the following from the project directory:
```
npm install create-elm-app -g
elm-app start
```
As Elm so nicely states, the project will be available at `localhost:3000`.
